# WindGym Examples

This folder contains example scripts and notebooks to help you get started with WindGym.

For a focused introduction to RL for biased-sensor yaw correction, see the [yaw-alignment lab](yaw_alignment/README.md): a single-turbine environment, PPO training, and paired baseline evaluation.

## Main Examples

The primary examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks:

| Example | Description | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Quick Start** | Fastest introduction to WindGym basics | Beginner |
| **Example 1: Make Environment** | Learn how to create and configure a WindGym environment with different settings | Beginner |
| **Example 2: Evaluate Pretrained Agent** | Evaluate a pre-trained reinforcement learning agent on wind farm scenarios | Intermediate |
| **Example 3: Load Results from Pre-Evaluated Model** | Load and analyze results from previously evaluated models | Intermediate |
| **Example 4: Change Wind Directions** | Changes the wind direction over time | Intermediate |
| **Example 5: Derating PyWake Surrogate** | Derating with a HAWCStab2-generated surrogate turbine (`PowerCtNDTabular` with a `derate` dimension): physics, env usage, rendered wakes | Intermediate |
| **Example 5b: Derating Fidelity Comparison** | The same 2-turbine derating scenario at three fidelities — pywake steady-state, dynamiks DWM, and HAWC2 + DTUWEC — side by side, with cross-fidelity sanity checks | Advanced |
| **Example Custom Rendering** | Custom visualization and rendering of wind farm simulations | Advanced |

## Additional Examples

### Agent Comparison
- `compare_agents_grid.py` - Compare multiple agents across a grid of wind conditions
- `compare_agents_sampling.py` - Compare agents using sampled wind conditions from a site

### Derating (HAWC2 backend)
- `hawc2_derating_2wt.py` - End-to-end PASS/FAIL validation of derating through the HAWC2 backend (2× DTU 10 MW inline, DTUWEC derate controller; ~10-30 min, needs a HAWC2 licence). Example 5b runs the same scenario inline as its fidelity C. The HAWC2 model itself (htc + Linux-only controller binaries) lives in `HawcFiles/`.

### Measurement Error and Uncertainty
The `measurement_error/` directory contains a full pipeline for training and evaluating agents under measurement uncertainty. See its [README](measurement_error/README.md) for details.

### Multi-Agent Environment
The `WindEnvMulti-example/` directory demonstrates how to use the PettingZoo-based multi-agent environment (`WindFarmEnvMulti`) with multiple turbines.
